# Portfolio Optimizer

This repo is a Django website for the portfolio optimization platform. Django is a python-based web framework with built-in database management API. This will help us efficiently store stock/financial data into a cloud database, but be able to easily access it using python and run whatever analysis we want. The results can then be stored and presented on this web platform.
